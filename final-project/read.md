•	An overview of the project
This capstone project for the "Machine Learning Engineer for Microsoft Azure" Udacity Nanodegree involves selecting a public external dataset to train a model using two approaches: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Hyperdrive. After comparing the performance of these methods, the best model will be deployed. The deployed model's endpoint will then be used to make predictions and answer relevant queries.



automl.ipynb: Notebook file used for running the AutoML experiments.
endpoint.py: Python script used to consume the deployed model's endpoint.
train.py: Python script utilized by Hyperdrive to perform runs and identify the best model.
hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb: Notebook used for running Hyperdrive experiments.
heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv: Dataset used for the experiments.
env.yml: Environment file downloaded from Azure ML Studio.
hyper-model.pkl: The best model from Hyperdrive, downloaded from Azure ML Studio.
model.pkl: The best model from AutoML, downloaded from Azure ML Studio.
scoring_file_pbi_v_1_0_0.py: Script downloaded from Azure ML Studio for deploying the model.
