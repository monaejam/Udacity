Before starting our experiment, we first register the dataset and configure a compute cluster for training. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is used to find the best classification model. The best model is then deployed as an HTTP REST endpoint using Azure Container Instances with authentication enabled. Application Insights is enabled for the deployed model using the logs.py script. We interact with the deployed model's documentation using Swagger. Finally, the model is consumed using the endpoint.py script.
